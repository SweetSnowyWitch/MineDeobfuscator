### After (mojang mappings)

</details>

All throwables logged using the log4j root logger will be remapped from intermediary mappings to mojang mappings.
This allows mod developers to more easily spot issues in a non-development environment as the errors are instantly
human-readable.

**Note:** This mod downloads yarn mappings on startup (or mojang mappings and intermediary mappings if configured).

## Compatibility

This mod only injects at a few places for crash reports to be remapped and only uses one vanilla method for getting the
current minecraft version, so this mod should be compatible with most future minecraft versions.
